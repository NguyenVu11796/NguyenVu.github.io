            <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">Artificial Intelligence
is an up-and-coming aspects of not only robotics but other field of
technologies as well in the recent decades. According to Brynjoffsson and
McAfee, for more than 250 years the cornerstone of economic growth has always
been technological innovations and inventions. They continued to elaborate that
the driving innovation of our era is artificial intelligence and its
associating fields. (Brynjoffsson and McAfee, 2019). Artificial Intelligence
(A.I) refers to the “intelligence” of machines and programs developed by
humans. This A.I machines, as long as they can pass the Turing Test, can be
considered truly intelligent robots. However, what stands behind the thinking
“brain” of a machine? There are many technologies involved in creating an A.I:
machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks. I am particularly
interested in machine learning, the ability of programs and machines to consume
massive data and use algorithms to create patterns within margins of errors to
predict and execute similar actions. Why is this such a big deal? One might
ask. There are two main reasons as to while machine learning and A.I in general
is making waves these few years back:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, humanity can now use machines and robots as a sounding board
to reflect upon our own intelligence and the human process through which we
carry out our task or approach the solution of a problem. For example, how do
we beat an opponent in an ancient game of Go chess? How do we know when to stop,
to speed up or slow down when we are in traffic? These questions can be answer
by programming machines and letting them do tasks that are repetitive. Through
machine learning, we can now automate many processes we already know how to
solve but don’t want to repeat. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, machine learning systems are outstanding learners:
humans pride ourselves as the smartest creatures on earth mostly due to our
frontal lobe: the place responsible for logic and experience-based learning.
Now, we are putting that advantage into machine learning systems, only better.
Unlike us, machine learning systems have much wider range of pattern stitching
and learning, as well as a vast space for information storage. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.I, and machine learning systems in specifics, has far-reaching
consequences in today’s ever automating world. Many low-skilled workers will be
replaced by automations. On the other spectrum, many corporations and companies
will cut costs and implement better, more complex machine learning systems that
can handle a variety of tasks in a short amount of time with maximum efficacy.
One of the most affected demographics will be the business community: “The
effect of AI will be magnified by the coming decade, as manufacturing,
retailing, transportation, finance, healthcare, law, advertising, insurance,
entertainment, education and virtually every other industry transform their
core processes and business models to take advantage of machine learning.”
(Brynjoffsson and McAfee, 2019) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Machine
learning and A.I is a welcoming transformation of the world for me because, as
an IT major and a machine learning scientist aspirant, I cannot wait till I
possess the necessary toolkit to understand and implement machine learning
systems to my project ideas like Particeps.&nbsp;</p>
