            <p class="u-text u-text-2">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<!--[endif]-->My
project idea involves creating an interactive e-learning application for both
PC’s and mobile’s operating systems that study an individual’s studying style
like visual or auditory and find out what is the best way to for that
individual to absorb new knowledge and information.&nbsp; To do this, the application will conduct a
medium length survey when after the user has signed up for an account the first
time. The survey will consist of 30-40 questions. In addition, the application
will ask for the user’s permission to import data from personality sites that
he or she has taken part in so that the software can use machine learning to
incorporate with the answers from its own survey and tabulate the user’s
strengths, personality, studying style, and interests. I call this software “Particeps”,
which means “companion” in Latin. The idea is that this software is not
necessarily your instructor or teacher but a tool and companion as well as a
sounding board for you to throw your ideas against and revise knowledge. To
better picture how this process works, look at the flow chart below:</p>

                <p class="u-text u-text-white u-text-2">Growing
up in a household of teachers and currently being a teacher myself, I have come
to appreciate different approach to pedagogy and self-learning. My father
taught me that a good approach to improvement and absorbing new information and
integrate that information to our toolkit is through endless practical
application and practice: instead of studying hypothetical situations or dry
mathematical equations or formula by heart, just do 100 to 1000 relating
problems or design a few projects that implement such mathematical formula. On
the other hand, my mother taught me that approach to text-heavy subjects should
be through constant referencing and extra self-reading. If you want to explore
an author’s work in depth, read his other work to find his pattern, his
literary style, his common message and aspirations, etc…. As a teacher myself I
find that approaching student in a superior-subordinate relationship commonly
found in conventional education to be outdated. Instead, why not be a companion
with mutual respect and experience to offer our students. That way, the
learners can feel more comfortable absorbing new information. With all that in
mind, I take a look at the increasing trend in e-learning. With the current
pandemic and ever developing communication technologies like Zoom and Google
meets, people are looking for alternatives from conventional face-to-face
meetings, or even with an instructor at all. According to UTEP Connect Extended
University, more than 6 million students are seeking to studying online.
Additionally, many applications modelled after “Do It Yourself” style has
burgeoned with the advent of smart phones and the non-stop development of
internet 3.0 and 4.0. I notice that many of these applications have static
interfaces, like “IETLS Preps” or other English learning software. Particeps
has the competitive edge of personalized and customizable interface tailored to
each user.&nbsp;</p>

Particeps will ask the users for their basic personal information to set up an
account in order to begin the personalization of their profile on the
application. Name, date of birth, basic education level, range of interests in
topics, etc.…. Afterwards, the application will ask the user to conduct a
survey of 30 questions of various topics: from how they would approach a
problem to how long they can concentrate, etc.…. After the survey is finished,
the application will ask for permission to import data from relating websites
that the user has visited for their personality tests (this is optional since
not everyone does the tests and agrees to grant permission). The application
then use search engine spiders or web crawlers to browser the web for relating
topics of education like videos if the user is a visual type or audio books if
the user is auditory leaning. The application offers a wide range of topic from
social sciences to natural sciences to DIY skills. As long as the web can offer
information on such topics, the application will be able to find knowledge to
give the users.</p>

involved in creating a software or application, especially one of this
magnitude. 
For this project, I intend to use
“AppSheet” to develop my application. I will also use Wix to create my only
page and connect it to a domain. As for my mobile extensions, I will use
“BuildFire” to develop a wireframe for my mobile application as well as
step-by-step coding, mostly will be javascript. The table below summarize the
tools and technologies involved to build my application&nbsp;</p>

developing this application: from web design to machine learning algorithms and
efficient command of several programming languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP,
JavaScript, Python, MySQL, C++, etc. In addition, a host server needs to be
established in order for the web page to send and receive as well as storing
information from user input.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-default u-text-white u-text-2">This is a project with great
undertaking and large scope. The skills involved are advanced and the upkeep of
the website as well as the mobile applications is required. However, if
executed adequately, the application will storm the market of e-learning due to
its competitive edge of personalized user interface as well as its wide range
of studying methods and its scope of information. The growing demand for online
study as well as self-study can be satiated and an innovative way of making
sure everyone can study during emergencies like the current pandemic is there
to be improved upon.&nbsp;</p>
